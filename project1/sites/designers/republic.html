		<h2>ABOUT</h2>
		<h3>Music</h3>
		<p>
		The Designers Republic (tDR for short) is a graphic design studio based in Sheffield, England, founded in 1986 by Ian Anderson and Nick Phillips. They are best known for electronic music logos and album artwork and their anti-establishment aesthetics, which embrace brash consumerism and the uniform style of corporate brands. Work by tDR is held in the permanent collections of <a href="" target="blank">MoMA</a> and the <a href="" target="blank">V&A</a>.
		</p>

		<h3>Closed</h3>
		<p>
		The studio in its larger form closed in January 2009, with Anderson stating that it would continue in a more 'slimline' form.
		</p>

		<h3>Style</h3>
		<p>
		Work by the Designers Republic is often playful and bright, and considered Maximum-minimalist, mixing images from Japanese anime and subvertised corporate logos, with a postmodern tendency towards controversial irony. It often features statements/slogans.
